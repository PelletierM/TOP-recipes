        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This sourdough starter recipe creates a lively mix of bacteria that will not only let the dough of any baking recipe rise, but also give it rich flavors. The older your sourdough starter, the better! So make sure you always keep some of it when you use it!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>70 g whole-wheat flour</li>
            <li>30 g rye flour</li>
            <li>100 ml water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a glass jar, mix the whole-wheat flour and rye flour with the water.</li>
            <li>Cover the glass jar with lid and let it sit at room temperature for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Keep half of the previous mix and repeat steps 1 and 2 by adding half of the ingredients to the mix. Repeat the same process for at least 7 days in a row.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The basic principle behind this process is that you should always feed the bacteria in your sourdough starter once it's done eating new ingredients (which takes about 12-24 hours). You then mix equal parts of starter and new flour/water to feed it.</p>
        <p>Once the starter is strong and stable, you can store it in the fridge just after feeding it and repeat the process only once a week.</p>
        <p>Whenever you want to use it for a recipe, like this amazing <a href="./sourdoughbread.html">  sourdough bread recipe</a>, you can simply take it out of the fridge and double its size every time you feed it until you have enough for both the recipe and storage. 
        </p>
        <p>As a rule of thumb, your starter should be ready to be used inside a recipe when it floats on water.</p>
