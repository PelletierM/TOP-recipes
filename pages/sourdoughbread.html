        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Session 1</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, mix the sourdough starter with the water.</li>
            <li>Put the flour in a large bowl, making a well in the center, and add the starter and water.</li>
            <li>Mix the ingredients until it becomes a rough dough, and let it rest for about <strong>45 minutes</strong>. Make sure that the bowl is covered, either with a towel or with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Take the dough out of the bowl and put it on a lightly floured surface. Add salt to the dough and knead it for about 10 minutes or until it's uniform and stretchy.</li>
            <li>Put the dough back in a large bowl and let it rest for <strong>4 hours</strong>. Again, make sure that the bowl is covered.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Session 2</h4>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>Take the dough out of the bowl and put it on a lightly floured surface. Knead it for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Form the dough in the shape of a ball and cover it with plastic wrap. Let it rest for <strong>30 minutes</strong>.</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic wrap, and gently stretch the dough and fold it on itself from bottom to top.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough 90 degrees and repeat the previous step. Do this 4 times in a row.</li>
            <li>Without kneading it, form and stretch the dough in the shape of a ball.</li>
            <li>Place the dough inside a proofing basket, with the seam facing upwards. Cover the basket with a towel and put it inside a plastic bag, so that the dough doesnt dry while it's proofing.</li>
            <li>Put the dough inside the fridge and let it rest for <strong>8 to 12 hours</strong>. The timing of this works best when you let the dough rest overnight.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Session 3</h4>
        <ol start="13">
            <li>Take the dough out of the fridge and let it rest at room temperature for about <strong>1 hour</strong>.</li>
            <li>Put Dutch oven (with lid on) inside your oven and preheat to 450 F.</li>
            <li>Once the oven has reached its temperature, put the dough inside the Dutch oven and scar the dough. Cover with lid and bake in the oven for <strong>50 minutes</strong>.</li>
            <li>Remove bread from the oven and let it rest on a cooling grid for <strong>15 minutes</strong>.</li>
            <li>ENJOY!</li>
